### Target Market
- **Primary Users**: Professional drummers, drum instructors, music students
- **Secondary Users**: Music producers, band members, transcription services, music schools
- **Market Size**: Global music education and production market with specific focus on percussion-focused workflows

### Core Value Proposition
"Get professional drum sheet music in seconds, not weeks" - GrooveSheet automates the entire transcription pipeline from audio upload to exportable notation, reducing a multi-hour manual process to under 60 seconds of automated processing.
